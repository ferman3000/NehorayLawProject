        <p>A rapid, sudden change in the movement of the head or neck can result in the brain impacting the inner
            surface of the skull. Such an impact can cause someone to suffer a brain injury. If someone suffers a brain
            injury as a result of the negligence or wrongful conduct of another person or corporation, the victim and
            the victim’s family may be entitled to compensation under California laws.</p>

            <p>After brain injury, things that once were easy and familiar become strange and difficult. A great deal of
                mental effort is usually required to do things that required little or no effort before the brain
                injury.</p>
            <p><strong>Work & Relationships:</strong> Work, school, and personal relationships suffer. The injured party
                often becomes less efficient at their job and their livelihood is jeopardized.</p>
            <p><strong>Behavioral Changes:</strong> Often they become unpredictable, unreliable, and sometimes violent.
                When the victim of a brain injury is a child, they can develop behavioral problems at home and school.
                Often they regress to an earlier development state.</p>
