                Unfortunately, after a serious accident, you or your loved one will be just another claim to an
                insensitive insurance company or corporation that will want to dispose of your claim for nothing or as
                little as possible, so that more profit can be reported to their shareholders. As sure as the sun will
                set in the west, insurance companies and corporations will routinely reject meritorious claims, make
                low-ball settlement offers, and employ unsavory tactics to avoid or limit their financial liability.

        <div class="clark-content-grid">

            <div class="clark-content-row">
                <h3>Personal Injury Actions</h3>
                <p>Personal injury actions require, by their very nature, that someone be injured. The requisite injury
                    can either by physical or, in some cases, emotional. The general goal of personal injury actions is
                    to place the blame for the injury on the party who caused it and to require them to compensate the
                    injured for the losses sustained.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="clark-content-row">
                <h3>Proving Liability & Causation</h3>
                <p>Not every injured plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for the injury he or she sustains. Besides
                    an injury, the plaintiff must establish, through evidence, that the defendant is legally liable for
                    his or her injuries. This requires proof of causation both in terms of actual, factual causation and
                    proximate, or legal causation. Whether legal causation is established depends on the facts and
                    circumstances of the particular matter in question. The defendant can be held liable as a result of
                    either the actions that are taken, or the actions that are not taken.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="clark-content-row">
                <h3>Intentional Conduct, Negligence & Strict Liability</h3>
                <p>Some personal injury actions revolve around legal causation derived from a concept of intentional
                    conduct, whereby it is generally held that if one intentionally harms another, or knows that the
                    conduct which is engaged in causes a substantial likelihood that harm will result, liability for the
                    resulting harm will in fact attach. Other personal injury actions have as their legal causation a
                    looser concept of fault called negligence. Under a negligence theory, in comparison, one is liable
                    for the results of actions, or inaction, where an ordinary person in the same position should have
                    foreseen that the conduct would create an unreasonable risk of harm to others. Still other types of
                    personal injury actions are based on strict liability, a no-fault system where liability may attach
                    regardless of the fault of the various parties, including the plaintiff.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="clark-content-row">
                <h3>Legal Defenses</h3>
                <p>In some situations, the defendant’s conduct, while questionable, does not rise to a level that
                    entitles the plaintiff to a recovery. For example, if a plaintiff knowingly and willfully chooses to
                    encounter a known hazard, the law holds that he or she has “assumed the risk of injury” and
                    therefore the defendant is not liable. This theory applies for instance in a case where the
                    plaintiff walks on an obvious build up of snow and ice caused by the defendant property owner’s
                    failure to shovel his sidewalk, falls and breaks her hip, and is unable to recover for her injuries
                    because she knew of the hazardous condition and willingly chose to encounter it. Plaintiffs are
                    denied recovery in other cases if their subjective belief about a situation does not match an
                    objective “reasonable person” standard. For instance, where the defendant approaches the plaintiff
                    and states “I might poke you in the eye if you wear that red sweater again,” it is likely that no
                    actionable assault occurred due to the fact that there was no immediate threat of harm that caused
                    reasonable apprehension on the part of the plaintiff.</p>
