            <h3>ESTABLISHING FAULT</h3>
            <p>A property owner or renter is not liable simply because a person falls and is injured on the property.
                The injured person must prove that the property owner was at fault or to blame.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A property owner may be to blame if the owner knew or should have known about a dangerous condition on
                the property. For example, a property owner has an open hole on the lot without warning notices or
                barricades. Or if someone spills something in the store and the store employee fails to clean it up in a
                reasonable time. The key word here is “reasonable”. It is up to the injured person to show that the
                spill was on the floor long enough for employees to know about it.</p>

            <h3>GATHERING EVIDENCE</h3>
            <p>It is very important to investigate slip and fall accidents as soon as possible to help prove that the
                property owner knew or should have known about the hazard. Look to see if there are foot prints, dirt or
                anything else that would show that the substance was on the floor for some time before the fall.</p>

            <h3>COMMON HAZARDS</h3>
            <p>There are many hazards that might cause a fall. Such as a foreign substance on the floor, poor lighting,
                a defect in the floor or other conditions. In Minnesota one of the most common causes of slip and falls
                are ice and snow. Property owners should keep their walks shoveled and relatively free of ice and snow.
