        <h3 class="wc-subtitle">What Benefits Fall Under Workers Compensation?</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">There are three major benefits that fall into the workers compensation category:
        </p>

        <ul class="wc-benefit-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Medical Expense</strong> – this covers the cost for hospitals, physicians, medical treatment,
                etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Disability Pay</strong> – either temporary, or permanent. This will depend on the severity of
                the injury. The amount varies, but can be as high as one-half to two-thirds of your normal pay.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Vocational Rehabilitation</strong> – if you are unable to perform the usual duties of your
                occupation due to your injury, you may need to be re-trained so that you can enter into a new trade or
                business. Also, physical therapy may be needed to obtain your pre-existing physical strength.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="wc-note">
        <p>If your employers conduct imposes on your physical well-being or restricts you from gaining your physical
            strength, he will be penalized and should be reported to deter such conduct in future situations. He could
            do so be neglecting to inquire on the origin of the accident, or by giving strict liability without inquiry
            into fault.</p>
