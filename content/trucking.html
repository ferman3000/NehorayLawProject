    <!-- INTRO TEXT -->
    <div class="tr-intro-text">
        <p>A high percentage of traffic crashes and deaths involve big rig trucks. A large big rig truck is any truck
            whose vehicle weight is over 10,000 pounds. Because of their size, crashes involving big rig trucks are more
            likely to result in serious injury and death than are car crashes. Approximately 10% of all those injured in
            a big rig truck crash will die. Bigrig trucks are more likely to be involved in multiple-vehicle crashes
            than are passenger cars. Both Federal and state regulations govern trucking and cover areas such as safety
            of equipment and hours of the drivers. Trucking companies are required to keep records of such information
            and it will be necessary to find and research such records. Poor equipment and driver fatigue can be causes
            of such crashes, and a careful study of the trucking company records may be needed to determine if
            negligence has occurred.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Because motorist safety is so important to prevent these types of serious bigrig
            injury accidents, The American Trucking Association has developed some “Share The Road” guidelines for
            motorists to follow.</p>

            <div class="tr-advice-col">
                <ul class="tr-check-list">
                    <li><strong>Never cut in front of a bigrig truck</strong> – Fully loaded bigrig trucks weigh up to
                        80,000 pounds and take the length of a football field to stop. Most cars weigh only 3,000
                        pounds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don’t linger alongside a bigrig truck</strong> – There are large blind spots around
                        bigrig trucks where cars momentarily “disappear” from view and the driver can’t see you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pass big rig trucks quickly</strong> – To make themselves visible cars should not linger
                        near bigrig trucks, and should move past them or slow to back off out of the blind spot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Changing lanes</strong> – Change lanes when you can see both of the bigrig truck’s
                        headlights in your rearview mirror.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- COLUMN 2 -->
            <div class="tr-advice-col">
                <ul class="tr-check-list">
                    <li><strong>If possible, pass a bigrig truck on the left, not on the right</strong> – A bigrig
                        truck’s blind spot on the right runs the length of the trailer and extends out 3 lanes.
                        Motorists should try to avoid passing through this large blind spot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep a safety cushion around bigrig trucks</strong> – Try to leave 10 car length safety
                        cushion in front of a bigrig truck and stay back 20-25 car lengths. Following a bigrig truck too
                        closely obscures your view.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check the bigrig truck’s mirrors</strong> – If you’re following a bigrig truck and you
                        can’t see the driver’s face in the bigrig truck’s side mirrors, the bigrig truck driver can’t
                        see you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Allow bigrig trucks adequate space to maneuver</strong> – Bigrig trucks make wide turns
                        at intersections and require additional lanes to turn, so motorists should allow a truck the
                        space it needs to maneuver.</li>

            <p>Trucking and Big Rig accident victims face medical bills, loss of wages, physical pain, emotional
                distress and loss of enjoyment of life. If injuries are severe or permanent, families suffer economic
                loss, mental anguish and the loss of companionship in caring for an injured family member. In the event
                of death, families are torn apart without any warning.</p>
