    <!-- INTRO TEXT (Content from MD) -->
    <div class="aa-intro-text">
        <p>There is a auto accident every 10 seconds of every day in America – over 6,000,000 every year. These auto
            accidents cause over 40,000 deaths and 3,000,000 injuries each year. Many auto accidents are caused by
            momentary mistakes or inattention, some by sleepy drivers, others by overly aggressive driving, still others
            by intoxicated drivers.</p>

            class="aa-featured-image">

        <p>A surprising number are caused by defects in the motor vehicle (bad tires or brakes), unclear road markers or
            signs, or road hazards-some of which may be created by sloppy construction. Many auto accidents are minor
            and involve more hassle than heartache, but the serious ones create significant problems for the innocent
            victims.</p>
        <p>Medical bills, lost wages, disability and physical incapacity, rehabilitation and future health care may seem
            insurmountable obstacles. Even figuring out the other driver’s insurance company and amount of insurance
            coverage can be a major problem.</p>
