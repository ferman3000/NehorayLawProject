        <p>Did you know that nearly <strong>2% of the American public is bitten by a dog each year?</strong> That’s
            millions of people every year. And almost 800,000 of those are serious enough to require medical attention.
            Dog bites can result in serious scarring and deformity. Some even result in death.</p>



        <p>An ancient legal rule was the <span class="highlight-gold">“one bite rule”</span>. This meant that a dog
            owner was generally not legally responsible the first time their dog bit someone. Most states have replaced
            this ancient rule with modern dog bite statutes. In fact, many states have imposed <strong>‘strict
                liability’</strong> on dog owners, even for their dog’s first bite.</p>

        <h3 class="db-subtitle">KEY STATISTICS & FACTS</h3>
        <ul class="db-arrow-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Frequency:</strong> Nearly 2% of the American public is bitten by a dog each year. 800,000 bites
                require serious medical attention annually.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Child Safety:</strong> Sadly, the odds that the victim of a fatal dog attack will be a child are
                <strong>7 out of 10</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Owner Liability:</strong> An owner, boarder, keeper, or harborer may be liable not only for a
                dog’s bite but also for other injuries caused by dogs.

    <!-- OWNER RESPONSIBILITY & SCARRING (Text Blocks) -->
    <div class="db-section-block">
        <h3 class="db-subtitle">OWNER RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
        <p>Pet owners are legally responsible for the behavior of their dogs. In most dog-bite cases, the dog’s owner
            will be required to pay for:</p>
        <ul class="db-check-list-simple">
            <li>Scarring and disfigurement</li>
            <li>Pain and suffering</li>
            <li>All medical bills and lost wages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most states have statutes making it difficult for dog owners to avoid liability for injuries caused by dog
            attacks. Sometimes the person taking care of the dog, often called the boarder, keeper or harborer, may also
            responsible.</p>

        <h3 class="db-impact-title">THE REALITY OF SCARRING</h3>
        <div class="db-impact-content">
            <p>Scars can be a serious, life-long result of a dog bite. Children are particularly susceptible to bites
                around the head and face and often suffer disfiguring scarring.</p>
            <p><strong>Physical & Emotional:</strong> Scars are more than physical injuries, also causing emotional
                injuries and fear. Scarring has a very real impact on self image and can have significant psychological
                impact.</p>
            <p><strong>Recovery:</strong> Scars may require plastic surgery which often must wait until the scar
                matures, usually about a year. In the case of a child, plastic surgery may need to wait until the child
                is finished growing after puberty.</p>
